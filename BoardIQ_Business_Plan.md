# BoardIQ — Business Plan & Revenue Model

## Executive Summary

BoardIQ is a SaaS platform connecting NYC co-op and condo boards with vetted building service vendors. The platform serves three stakeholders — building boards, property management companies, and vendors — each with a distinct pricing relationship designed to drive adoption from the top of the funnel (management) and monetize at the point of transaction (bids and contracts).

**Core thesis:** Property management companies are given the software free to drive building adoption. Boards pay a small monthly fee for premium compliance and benchmarking tools. The primary revenue engine is a 2% transaction fee on contract value flowing through the platform during the bid request and contract negotiation phase.

## Market Overview

**Total Addressable Market (NYC)**
- ~30,000 co-op and condo buildings in NYC
- Average annual vendor spend per building: $80,000–$250,000
- Estimated total vendor contract value: $4.5B annually
- Primary service categories: elevator maintenance, plumbing, electrical, pest control, cleaning, HVAC, fire safety, roofing, painting, security

**Key Pain Points**
- Boards lack visibility into whether they're overpaying (no benchmarking)
- Compliance deadlines (Local Law 11, 87, 97, etc.) create urgent, high-value procurement events
- Vendors have no efficient channel to reach decision-makers at multiple buildings
- Management companies manually coordinate bid collection via email and spreadsheets

## Customer Segments & Pricing

### 1. Property Management Companies — FREE

**Rationale:** Management companies are the distribution channel. Each management company controls 20–200+ buildings. Giving them the platform free creates a top-of-funnel engine that onboards buildings at scale.

**What they get:**
- Portfolio-wide compliance dashboard
- Centralized vendor management across all buildings
- BidBoard: automated bid request creation and collection
- Contract tracking and expiration alerts
- Benchmarking data across their portfolio

**Why free works:** Management companies don't pay for the buildings' vendor contracts — the buildings do. By giving management companies free access, we ensure they adopt BoardIQ as their standard operating tool, which automatically brings their buildings onto the platform.

### 2. Building Boards — $49/month per building

**Rationale:** Boards are the economic buyers of vendor services. A small monthly fee unlocks premium tools that justify the cost many times over through better vendor pricing.

**What they get (free tier):**
- Basic compliance calendar
- Vendor directory access
- View bid requests from their management company

**What they get (paid tier — $49/mo):**
- Full cost benchmarking against peer buildings
- Savings opportunity identification
- Contract performance tracking
- Historical spend analytics
- Priority bid request creation
- Access to vendor insurance/compliance verification

**Revenue math:**
- 500 buildings × $49/mo = $294,000 ARR
- 2,000 buildings × $49/mo = $1,176,000 ARR
- Low churn expected: compliance deadlines create recurring need

### 3. Vendors — 2% Transaction Fee on Platform-Facilitated Contracts

**This is the primary revenue driver.**

**How it works:**
When a bid request is created on BoardIQ (triggered by a compliance deadline, expiring contract, or board request), vendors submit proposals through the platform. When a vendor wins the contract and the board commits through BoardIQ, a 2% platform fee is applied to the annual contract value.

**Fee structure:**
- 2% of annual contract value for new contracts facilitated through BidBoard
- Fee is charged to the winning vendor (cost of customer acquisition)
- Fee is one-time per contract year, not recurring monthly
- Minimum fee: $50 per contract
- Maximum fee: $5,000 per contract (caps exposure on very large contracts)

**Example transactions:**

| Service | Annual Contract | 2% Fee |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Elevator maintenance | $24,000/yr | $480 |
| Cleaning services | $48,000/yr | $960 |
| Pest control | $8,400/yr | $168 |
| Plumbing retainer | $18,000/yr | $360 |
| Fire safety compliance | $35,000/yr | $700 |
| HVAC maintenance | $42,000/yr | $840 |
| Local Law 11 facade work | $180,000 | $3,600 |

**Why vendors pay 2%:** The fee replaces far more expensive customer acquisition costs. A vendor typically spends $500–$2,000+ in sales time per building relationship. BoardIQ delivers qualified, ready-to-buy leads with specific scope, budget, and timeline — at a fraction of traditional sales cost.

**Revenue math (transaction fees):**

| Scenario | Buildings | Avg contracts/yr | Avg value | Annual GMV | 2% Revenue |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Year 1 (launch) | 200 | 2 | $30,000 | $12M | $240,000 |
| Year 2 (growth) | 800 | 3 | $35,000 | $84M | $1,680,000 |
| Year 3 (scale) | 2,500 | 3.5 | $40,000 | $350M | $7,000,000 |
| Mature (5yr) | 5,000 | 4 | $45,000 | $900M | $18,000,000 |

## Revenue Model Summary

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Board subscriptions ($49/mo) | $117,600 | $470,400 | $1,470,000 |
| Transaction fees (2%) | $240,000 | $1,680,000 | $7,000,000 |
| Vendor subscriptions (legacy, optional) | $30,000 | $60,000 | $100,000 |
| **Total Revenue** | **$387,600** | **$2,210,400** | **$8,570,000** |

**Blended take rate at maturity:** ~2.2% of GMV (transaction fees + subscriptions as % of total contract value flowing through platform)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

**Phase 1 — Century Management (Current)**
- 125 buildings under management
- Prove the model with a single management company
- Target: 50 active buildings, 100 bid requests, 30 completed contracts

**Phase 2 — NYC Management Company Expansion**
- Target top 20 NYC management companies (each managing 50–500 buildings)
- Sales motion: "Your competitor Century Management is using BoardIQ to cut vendor costs 15%"
- Goal: 5 management companies, 500 buildings

**Phase 3 — Direct Board Acquisition**
- Self-serve onboarding for boards without a management company
- Content marketing: compliance guides, cost benchmarking reports
- Partnerships with board member associations

**Phase 4 — Geographic Expansion**
- Expand beyond NYC to other major metros with co-op/condo density
- Chicago, Boston, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Compliance-driven demand:** NYC buildings face mandatory compliance deadlines (Local Law 11, 87, 97) that create time-sensitive, high-value procurement events. BoardIQ is the only platform that connects compliance tracking directly to vendor procurement.

2. **Management company distribution:** Free tier for management companies creates a distribution channel that onboards buildings 50–200 at a time, vs. one-by-one sales.

3. **Benchmarking moat:** Each transaction adds pricing data to the benchmarking engine. More buildings → better benchmarks → more buildings join for data → network effect.

4. **Transaction alignment:** The 2% fee model aligns incentives — BoardIQ only makes money when vendors win contracts, which means the platform is motivated to deliver quality matches and competitive pricing.

## Key Metrics to Track

- **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value):** Total contract value facilitated through the platform
- **Take rate:** Transaction fees as % of GMV (target: 2%)
- **Buildings active:** Buildings with at least 1 bid request in last 90 days
- **Bid request volume:** Number of bid requests created per month
- **Conversion rate:** Bid requests that result in a signed contract
- **Average contract value:** Trending indicator of market positioning
- **Net revenue retention:** Year-over-year revenue per building cohort

## Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Vendors bypass platform after first introduction | Contracts initiated through BoardIQ have platform terms; multi-year tracking; relationship credit system |
| Boards resist $49/mo fee | Free tier available; ROI easily demonstrated via first benchmarking report showing overpayment |
| 2% fee perceived as too high by vendors | Cap at $5K; compare to typical 5–10% broker fees or $2K+ sales cost per lead |
| Management companies resist adoption | Free tier eliminates cost objection; offer white-label option for premium partners |
| Slow contract velocity | Compliance deadlines create natural urgency; expiring contract alerts drive consistent bid request flow |
